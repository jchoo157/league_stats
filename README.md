# LeagueStats

Using the League of Legends API, this application allows users to look up recent gaming histories of players and view champions played, KDA, item builds, teams, and more. You can also view all champions currently in the game and check out each individual characters abilities, lore, and stats. I will continue to develop this application to allow players to look up stats of live games, introduction to item builds, and best champion match ups.


You can check out the live version [here] (https://leaguestats2016.herokuapp.com/).
